# 2022-2023 Praxis Cohort Charter

### Preamble or Intro
This document intends to lay out the values and practices most important for us as a cohort. It is a living document to be revised at least once per semester. During the Praxis learning process, we hope to grow comfortable with engaging play as a critical practice through our interactions with techniques and technologies of DH. We aim for our time together to be a lab for generating collaborative work strategies that rise against the alienating lone-wolf scholar tradition in the humanities and social sciences.

### Cohort Culture
* Have lunch together every Wednesday after Code Lab.
* For group tasks, always discuss what structure would best suit our abilities and schedules. Never assume.
* Be aware of your colleagues; don't wait for them to share discomfort or any kind of difficulties. Reach out and offer your help regularly.
* Don't let problems bottle up. It's better to nip issues in the bud. Similarly, you're likely to spend less time stuck on a particular task if you ask for help. If you are still very stuck after 30 minutes, it's time to ask for help. 
* Have social events to celebrate milestones. It's important to pause and have fun.
* Following Katherine McKittrick's interdisciplinary anticolonial methodology, cultivate a spirit of curiousity and wonder as we tackle our tasks collectively and individually. In Dear Science she reminds us, "The method is rigorous too. Wonder is study. Curiousity is attentive" (5).
* Remember that mental and physical health are priorities. 

### Accountability 
* Break your goal into itemizable tasks that you can assign cohort members.
* Have weekly check-ins through Slack regardless of whether you we were able to complete your tasks or not. It's important to know what is truly achievable!
* It's okay to backtrack, don't feel bad about it. Just be sure to constantly share your process with your colleagues. 
* Eveything is negotiable except communication. If all fails, good communication will be the key to get back on track or reassess a common goal.
