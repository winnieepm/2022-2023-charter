# 2022-2023 Praxis Cohort Charter

### About the charter
This document intends to lay out the values and practices most important for us as a cohort. It is a living document to be revised at least once per semester. During the Praxis learning process, we hope to grow comfortable with engaging play as a critical practice through our interactions with techniques and technologies of DH. We aim for our time together to be a lab for generating collaborative work strategies that rise against the alienating lone-wolf scholar tradition so common within the humanities and social sciences.

### Cohort Culture
* Have lunch together every Wednesday after Code Lab.
* For group tasks, always discuss what structure would best suit our abilities and schedules. Never assume.
* Be aware of your colleagues; don't wait for them to share discomfort or any kind of difficulties. Reach out and offer your help regularly.
* Don't let problems bottle up. It's better to nip issues in the bud. Similarly, you're likely to spend less time stuck on a particular task if you ask for help. If you are still very stuck after 30 minutes, it's time to ask for help. 
* Have social events to celebrate milestones. It's important to pause and have fun.
* Following Katherine McKittrick's interdisciplinary anticolonial methodology, cultivate a spirit of curiousity and wonder as we tackle our tasks collectively and individually. In Dear Science she reminds us, "The method is rigorous too. Wonder is study. Curiousity is attentive" (5).
* Remember that mental and physical health are priorities. 

### Accountability 
* Break your goal into itemizable tasks that you can assign cohort members.
* Have weekly check-ins through Slack regardless of whether you we were able to complete your tasks or not. It's important to know what is truly achievable!
* It's okay to backtrack, don't feel bad about it. Just be sure to constantly share your process with your colleagues. 
* Eveything is negotiable except communication. If all fails, good communication will be the key to get back on track or reassess a common goal.

### Personal Goals

1. Learn how to ask good digital humanities questions. 
2. Sketch out ideas for how to integrate DH as an applied practice in my research.
3. Develop good habits for overcoming frustration when coding.
4. Learn (or start to learn) how to make visual stories with data.
5. Interact with different people working within DH or DH-adjacent work.
6. Learn to describe my coding ideas well by writing them out.

##### Samantha
1. Be open to where this process leads me.
2. Immerse myself fully into coding as a practice.
3. Tell good stories with my work.
4. Embrace failure. Be honest when I am struggling.
5. Improve my digital artistic skills.
6. Better understand landscape of DH job opportunities.
7. Connect to the larger DH community.

##### Caroline
1. Learn new digial skills, namely: coding, photogrammetry, 3D modeling, and GIS. 
2. Always be thankful for the opprotuniy to learn new things, even coding! ;)
3. Enhance my professional development in new ways, such as digital pedagogy, how to converse about DH, and enhance my CV/website. 
4. Make strong connections in the Scholar's Lab. 
5. Explore DH jobs opprotunities.

##### Malcolm
1. Practice generosity, reciprocity, vulnerability, and mutuality with members of my cohort and folks in the Scholar's Lab
2. Cultivate a growth mindset, ask for help, and become more comfortable with failure and frustration. With Katherine McKittrick in mind "practice curiousity, over knowing all things." 
3. Become proficient in Python, Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, and other programming languages and tools
4. Become more familiar with the digital humanities (DH) and its opportunities and limitations in addition to alt-ac and DH career opportunities
5. Learn with and from the members of my cohort
6. Leverage opportunities and community in the Scholar's Lab to visualize, outline, and develop a mapping and storytelling component to my research
